## Game Instructions

The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.

**This game can be played only against another human player and on a single command line.
**

- Start the game by  following the instructions below.
- Enter your names when promted.
- Take turns as guided on-screen.
- You can play the game again at the end of a round.
